To improve JNK3 activity, a common strategy is to combine key pharmacophores known to enhance binding affinity, such as incorporating heterocyclic scaffolds with hydrogen bond donors/acceptors and halogenated aromatic rings for better interactions in the ATP-binding site of JNK3. I propose a hybrid molecule that merges the piperidinone sulfonamide motif from the first molecule with the thiazolopyrimidine core from the second, while adding a para-fluoro substituent on the phenyl ring to enhance binding through halogen bonding.

The first molecule features a methoxy-substituted pyrimidine ring with an amine linked to a bicyclic amine moiety, which likely contributes to binding affinity. The second molecule has an amide and a thiazole fused to a benzofuran, but with lower activity.

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose combining the favorable features of the first molecule (methoxy-pyrimidine and bicyclic amine) with an additional hydrogen bond acceptor or donor to enhance interactions. Introducing a hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring of the first molecule could increase polarity and potential hydrogen bonding without disrupting the core scaffold. Also, replacing the positively charged nitrogen in the bicyclic amine with a neutral amine might improve membrane permeability and binding.

Thus, I propose a molecule based on the first scaffold, adding a hydroxyl group ortho to the methoxy group on the pyrimidine ring and converting the quaternary ammonium to a tertiary amine.

The second molecule contains an acetylated amine linked to a substituted aromatic ring with a trifluoromethyl group and a fluorophenyl moiety, which likely contributes to its higher activity. To improve the JNK3 score further, I propose combining the key features of the second molecule (aromatic system with electron-withdrawing groups like CF3 and F) with a modification to increase binding affinity, such as introducing a hydrogen bond donor or acceptor group to enhance interactions with the JNK3 active site. 

Specifically, I propose replacing the acetyl group (CC(=O)N-) with a hydroxamic acid moiety (C(=O)NHOH), which is known to chelate metal ions and improve kinase inhibition in some cases. This modification could increase binding affinity and thus the JNK3 score. The rest of the molecule remains similar to the second molecule to retain its beneficial aromatic features.

The proposed molecule SMILES is: CCONC(=O)NC1=CC=C(NCC2=CC=CC=C2F)C(C(F)(F)F)=C1, but replacing the acetyl group with hydroxamic acid gives: CCONC(=O)NHOCC1=CC=C(NCC2=CC=CC=C2F)C(C(F)(F)F)=C1 is invalid because of chain break.

COc1ccccc1C(=O)NC2=CC=CC3=C2N=CN=C3N4CCOCC4

with the morpholine ring replaced by a piperidine-oxymethyl group and the thiazole ring fused to the bicyclic system.

To keep the molecule valid and synthetically reasonable, I propose the following SMILES:

COc1ccccc1C(=O)NC2=CC=CC3=C2N=CN=C3N4CCN(CCO)CC4

This molecule retains the benzamide and fused bicyclic heterocycle, replaces morpholine with a piperidine ring bearing an oxymethyl substituent, and includes a methoxyphenyl group to enhance binding.

The second molecule is a purine derivative with a piperidine substituent but lacks the phenolic and methoxy groups present in the first molecule.

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose combining the beneficial features of both molecules: retain the methoxyphenol amide moiety from the first molecule, which may contribute to binding via hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, and incorporate the bicyclic purine system from the second molecule, which is more nitrogen-rich and may enhance binding affinity.

Additionally, I will introduce a hydroxyl group on the piperidine ring to increase hydrogen bonding potential, as seen in the first molecule's piperidine ring, which may improve activity.

Thus, the proposed molecule is a hybrid: a methoxyphenol amide linked to a purine fused bicyclic system with a hydroxylated piperidine ring.

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose to combine the favorable features of the first molecule (higher score) with some polar substituents that may enhance binding, while avoiding potentially detrimental groups like nitro. Specifically, I will keep the benzamide linked to the bicyclic imidazo-pyridine core from the first molecule, retain the 3-hydroxy-pyrrolidine substituent (which may form hydrogen bonds), and introduce a small polar substituent such as a fluorine on the phenyl ring to potentially improve binding affinity and metabolic stability.

This new molecule is expected to have improved interactions with JNK3 due to the retained hydrogen bonding groups and enhanced binding from the fluorine substituent, potentially increasing the JNK3 score beyond 0.18.

To design a molecule with a potentially higher JNK3 score, I propose combining the key features of the first molecule that likely contribute to activity (the nitro-oxadiazole and sulfonamide groups) with the fluorophenyl group from the second molecule, which may enhance binding through hydrophobic or halogen bonding interactions. Additionally, I will introduce a small mutation by replacing the methyl groups on the pyrimidine ring with a hydroxyl group to increase hydrogen bonding potential.

This hybrid molecule maintains the core heterocyclic system and sulfonamide from the first molecule, incorporates the fluorophenyl group from the second, and adds a hydroxyl group to improve binding affinity, which should increase the JNK3 score.

Additionally, replacing the chloroacetamide side chain with a less reactive but still polar group like a hydroxyl or methoxy group could improve binding and reduce potential toxicity. Therefore, I propose a molecule with the bicyclic core and pyrrolidine ring from the first molecule, attached via an amide to a 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl group, and replacing the chloroacetamide with a simple methoxy substituent on the phenyl ring to maintain polarity and improve binding. This hybrid and slightly mutated molecule is expected to have a higher JNK3 score due to improved interactions and better pharmacophore features.

The presence of the hydroxyl group may reduce activity, possibly due to increased polarity or unfavorable interactions.

A common strategy to improve kinase inhibitor activity is to combine key pharmacophores from both molecules, such as the fluorinated aromatic ring and sulfonamide group from the second molecule, with the heterocyclic nitrogen-containing rings from the first molecule, which may enhance binding affinity and selectivity.

Therefore, I propose a new molecule that merges the fluorinated phenyl-sulfonamide moiety from the second molecule with the pyridine and fluorinated aromatic system from the first molecule, connected via an amide linker to maintain rigidity and proper orientation for binding. This hybrid structure is expected to improve interactions with JNK3 and thus increase the biological activity score.

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose to combine features of both molecules and introduce a slight modification to enhance binding affinity or molecular interactions. Morpholine provides polarity and potential hydrogen bonding, while piperidine offers hydrophobicity and conformational flexibility.

A reasonable mutation is to replace the morpholine ring with a 4-hydroxypiperidine ring, which retains the piperidine scaffold but adds a hydroxyl group to increase hydrogen bonding capacity, potentially improving binding to JNK3.

Thus, the proposed molecule keeps the original scaffold, replaces the N2 substituent with a 4-hydroxypiperidine, and retains the methoxy groups on the phenyl ring.

The presence of the hydroxyl group may reduce activity, possibly due to increased polarity or unfavorable interactions.

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose to combine the favorable features of the first molecule but introduce a small hydrophobic substitution on the piperidine ring to enhance binding affinity without increasing polarity too much.

Additionally, the phenyl ring has two methoxy groups in the first molecule and one methoxy plus one hydroxy in the second. The dimethoxy substitution seems better for activity, so I will keep that.

The current molecule has a morpholine moiety (OCCN3CCOCC3) and a fluorophenyl group, which are beneficial for solubility and binding. One potential improvement is to replace the fluorine atom on the phenyl ring with a trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is bulkier and more lipophilic, potentially increasing hydrophobic interactions and improving binding affinity.

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose combining the bicyclic fused heteroaromatic system from the second molecule (which may enhance binding via additional π-stacking or H-bond interactions) with the thiazolidine ring from the first molecule (which may contribute to better fit or interactions in the binding pocket). Additionally, I will keep the fluorophenyl substitution on the piperazine from the first molecule, as fluorine often improves binding affinity and metabolic stability.

Thus, the new molecule will have the methoxy-pyrimidine core linked to an aniline bearing the bicyclic fused heteroaromatic system (from molecule 2), connected to a piperazine substituted with a fluorophenyl group and bearing the thiazolidine ring (from molecule 1).

To propose a molecule with potentially higher activity, I will combine the beneficial features of both molecules: retain the morpholine-containing side chain and the thiazole-pyrazole system from the first molecule, and introduce the trifluoromethyl group from the second molecule to increase lipophilicity and metabolic stability. Additionally, I will keep the fluorine substituent on the aromatic ring to maintain favorable interactions.

This hybrid molecule is expected to have improved binding affinity and biological activity against JNK3."

To improve the JNK3 activity, we can consider modifying the molecule to enhance binding affinity or selectivity. The current molecule has a methoxy-substituted phenyl ring, a fluorophenyl group, and a morpholine-containing side chain. Literature suggests that introducing additional hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, or increasing molecular rigidity, can improve kinase inhibition. One possible modification is to replace the morpholine ring with a piperazine ring, which can provide an additional basic nitrogen for interaction and potentially improve binding. Also, adding a hydroxyl group on the phenyl ring might increase hydrogen bonding. Therefore, I propose replacing the morpholine (O in the ring) with piperazine (N in the ring) and adding a hydroxyl group ortho to one of the methoxy groups on the phenyl ring to increase polarity and potential interactions, which may increase the JNK3 score.

The current molecule has a trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl ring and a morpholine-containing side chain. One potential modification is to replace the morpholine ring with a piperazine ring, which introduces an additional nitrogen that can serve as a hydrogen bond acceptor/donor, potentially increasing binding affinity.

These changes may enhance the molecule's JNK3 inhibitory activity. 

Proposed molecule: Replace the morpholine (O in the ring) with piperazine (N in place of O), and replace the trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) with a cyano group (C#N) on the phenyl ring.

SMILES of original fragment: OCCN4CCOCC4 (morpholine side chain)

Modified fragment: OCCN4CCNCC4 (piperazine side chain)

Original phenyl substituent: c1ccc(C(F)(F)F)c(F)c1

Modified phenyl substituent: c1ccc(C#N)c(F)c1

Incorporating these changes into the original molecule yields:

This molecule is valid and expected to have improved JNK3 activity due to enhanced hydrogen bonding and polarity."

Introducing a hydroxyl group on the morpholine ring could improve solubility and form additional hydrogen bonds with the kinase active site, potentially increasing activity.

Thus, I propose a molecule based on the first scaffold, but with a hydroxyl substitution on the morpholine ring and retention of the trifluoromethyl group to maintain hydrophobic interactions and metabolic stability.

The current molecule has a trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl ring and a morpholine-containing side chain. One potential modification is to replace the morpholine ring with a piperazine ring, which introduces an additional nitrogen that can serve as a hydrogen bond acceptor/donor, potentially increasing binding affinity.

Proposed molecule: Replace the morpholine (O in the ring) with piperazine (N in place of O), and replace the trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) with a cyano group (C#N) on the phenyl ring.

This hybrid molecule maintains the sulfonamide and piperazine core from the second molecule but incorporates the trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl rings from the first, aiming to synergize their beneficial effects and thus increase the JNK3 score beyond 0.62.

The rest of the molecule is largely the same, including a piperazine ring, a fluorophenyl ether, and a complex heterocyclic system with a thiazole and pyrazole moiety.

Given that the chlorine substitution on the phenyl ring seems to improve activity compared to fluorine, one strategy to improve the score further is to introduce a stronger electron-withdrawing or lipophilic group that might enhance binding affinity. A common bioisostere for chlorine is a bromine atom, which is larger and more lipophilic and can sometimes improve binding in hydrophobic pockets.

Therefore, I propose replacing the chlorine atom in the first molecule with a bromine atom, keeping the rest of the structure unchanged. This mutation might increase hydrophobic interactions and improve the JNK3 score beyond 0.61.

Wait, the difference between OC(F)(F)F and OCF3 is subtle but important: OC(F)(F)F is a difluoromethoxy group, OCF3 is trifluoromethoxy.

So replacing OC(F)(F)F with OCF3:

No, I need to write the new SMILES with OCF3 instead of OC(F)(F)F:

OCF3 = OCF3

The first molecule has a sulfonamide group and a trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl ring, which may contribute to binding affinity. The second molecule has multiple fluorines and a fused heterocyclic system with amide and ether linkages.

To propose a molecule with potentially higher JNK3 activity, I will combine favorable features from both molecules: retain the trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl ring and sulfonamide group from the first molecule, and incorporate the fused heterocyclic system and multiple fluorines from the second molecule.

Given that the chlorine substitution on the phenyl ring seems to improve activity compared to fluorine, one strategy to improve the score further is to introduce a stronger electron-withdrawing or lipophilic group that might enhance binding affinity. A common bioisostere for chlorine is a bromine atom, which is larger and more lipophilic and can sometimes improve binding in hydrophobic pockets.

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose to combine the rigid bicyclic heteroaromatic core and the morpholine sulfonamide motif from the first molecule with the additional hydrogen bonding groups from the second molecule's pyrimidine and cyanide substituents, which may enhance binding interactions. Also, maintaining the trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl sulfonamide is important for potency. This hybrid design aims to increase molecular interactions and rigidity, potentially improving the JNK3 activity beyond 0.72.

Their JNK3 scores are equal (0.58), suggesting similar activity levels. To improve the score, I propose combining favorable elements from both molecules and introducing a slight modification to enhance binding or pharmacokinetic properties.

From the first molecule, the presence of a 1,3,4-oxadiazole-like heterocycle fused with a nitrogen-rich bicyclic system and multiple sulfonamide groups seems beneficial. From the second molecule, the chlorophenyl group and the morpholine-like ring (oxygen-containing heterocycle) may improve solubility and binding.

A reasonable mutation is to replace one of the trifluoromethyl groups with a cyano group (-CN), which is known to enhance binding through hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions and can improve metabolic stability. Also, incorporating a morpholine ring instead of a piperazine may improve solubility and reduce off-target effects.

Therefore, I propose a molecule that retains the sulfonamide-piperazine core, keeps the trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic ring, introduces a cyano substituent on the aromatic ring, and replaces one piperazine with a morpholine ring. This hybrid and mutation approach aims to increase binding affinity and improve drug-like properties, potentially increasing the JNK3 score beyond 0.58.

Thus, the proposed molecule keeps the core scaffold, the sulfonamide phenyl ring with trifluoromethyl and fluorine, replaces the piperazine substituent with a morpholine sulfonamide, and extends the amide substituent to include a hydroxyphenyl linked to a fused heterocycle similar to the first molecule but with an additional nitrogen to increase hydrogen bonding potential.

- The first molecule has a complex fused heterocyclic system with a thiazolidine ring and trifluoromethyl groups, which may enhance binding affinity and metabolic stability.
- The second molecule has multiple fluorine substitutions and a piperazine ring, which can improve solubility and binding.

A rational approach is to combine the sulfonamide and trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic system from the first molecule with the piperazine and fluorinated aromatic systems from the second molecule, while maintaining the amide linkage and heterocyclic cores that are likely important for activity.

Additionally, introducing a small mutation such as adding an extra fluorine on the aromatic ring or replacing a methoxy group with a trifluoromethoxy group could enhance binding through increased hydrophobic interactions and metabolic stability.

Therefore, I propose a molecule that merges the sulfonamide-trifluoromethyl aromatic system and the piperazine-fluorinated aromatic system, with an added trifluoromethoxy substitution on the aromatic ring to potentially increase JNK3 activity."

In the current molecule, the amide linkage and sulfonamide are key interaction points. I propose to replace one of the trifluoromethyl groups (–CF3) on the phenyl ring attached to the sulfonamide with a hydroxyl group (–OH). This mutation could increase hydrogen bonding potential and improve binding affinity, potentially increasing the JNK3 score.

Thus, I will modify the phenyl ring substituent from C(F)(F)F to a para-hydroxy substituent (–OH) while keeping the rest of the molecule intact. This is a conservative mutation aimed at improving binding without drastically changing the molecular scaffold.

The higher score of the first molecule suggests that the presence of the piperidine ring linked to the sulfonamide and the fluorophenyl amine substitution on the piperazine improves activity.

To propose a molecule with potentially higher JNK3 activity, I will combine the beneficial features of both molecules and introduce a small mutation to enhance binding affinity.

To design a molecule with a potentially higher JNK3 score, I propose combining the beneficial features of both molecules: 
- Retain the oxazole ring from the second molecule, which may enhance binding through hydrogen bonding.
- Incorporate the trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatic sulfonamide from the first molecule, which may improve hydrophobic interactions and metabolic stability.
- Keep the extended aromatic amine substituent from the second molecule, which includes the [nH] heterocycle, possibly improving π-stacking and binding.

1. Retain the core scaffold and the sulfonamide aryl group with trifluoromethyl and halogen substitutions, as these likely contribute to potency.

- Both molecules contain a sulfonamide group attached to a piperazine ring, which is important for activity.
- Both have aromatic systems with fluorine and trifluoromethyl substitutions, which can enhance binding affinity and metabolic stability.
- The first molecule has a fused bicyclic system with nitrogen heterocycles, while the second has multiple heterocycles including oxazoles and pyridines.
- The first molecule’s score is slightly higher (0.72), possibly due to its more rigid fused bicyclic system and specific fluorine placement.

To improve the score, I propose a crossover molecule that combines the rigid fused bicyclic core of the first molecule with the diverse heterocyclic substitutions and additional fluorine/chlorine substitutions from the second molecule. Additionally, I will introduce a methoxy group on the aromatic ring to improve solubility and potential interactions, as seen in the second molecule.

2. Replace the N4CCNCC4 substituent on the pyridine ring (from molecule 2) with the 4-nitro-1,2-oxazole ring (from molecule 1's -n4cco4) to introduce additional hydrogen bonding and polarity, which may improve binding.
3. Keep the sulfonamide and other key pharmacophores intact.
4. Additionally, introduce a fluorine atom on the phenyl ring attached to the amide (from molecule 1) to enhance binding via halogen bonding.

This crossover and mutation strategy aims to combine hydrophobic and polar interactions to improve JNK3 activity beyond 0.72.

Their JNK3 scores are close (0.74 and 0.72), suggesting both are active but with room for improvement.

To propose a molecule with potentially higher JNK3 activity, I will combine favorable features from both molecules and introduce a small mutation to enhance binding affinity:

1. Retain the core scaffold and the trifluoromethyl-substituted phenyl sulfonamide from the first molecule, as trifluoromethyl groups often improve binding through hydrophobic interactions and metabolic stability.

2. Incorporate the phenol group from the second molecule's sulfonamide substituent, which can form additional hydrogen bonds with the target.

3. Modify the piperazine substituent to include a hydroxyl group (as in the phenol) to increase polarity and potential hydrogen bonding, which may improve binding affinity and selectivity.

4. Keep the amide and other aromatic substitutions intact to maintain the core binding interactions.

Both have the same JNK3 score of 0.71, suggesting these substitutions do not significantly affect activity.

To potentially improve the JNK3 score, I propose introducing a bioisosteric replacement of the trifluoromethyl group with a trifluoromethoxy group (-OCF3), which can enhance binding affinity by adding an oxygen that can participate in additional hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions, while maintaining the electron-withdrawing and lipophilic character. Additionally, replacing the chloro substituent with a fluorine can improve metabolic stability and binding due to its smaller size and strong electronegativity.

Thus, the proposed molecule keeps the core scaffold and the piperazine sulfonamide motif but modifies the phenyl ring substituents to 4-fluoro and 3-trifluoromethoxy, which may enhance binding affinity and thus increase the JNK3 score."

This crossover and mutation approach aims to retain key pharmacophores while enhancing molecular properties that could increase the JNK3 score beyond 0.76."

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose to enhance interactions with the kinase active site by introducing a small hydrophobic group that can improve binding affinity without drastically changing the scaffold. One common strategy is to replace one of the fluorines with a methyl group to increase hydrophobic contacts and possibly improve potency. Additionally, adding a methoxy group on the phenyl ring attached to the sulfonamide could improve solubility and binding through potential hydrogen bonding. This mutation keeps the core scaffold intact, preserving key interactions, while potentially increasing activity.

The main differences lie in the heterocyclic ring attached to the core and the sulfonamide substituent.

The second molecule has a thiazole ring (N2C=CS2) and a piperazine with a sulfonamide linked to a trifluoromethyl and chlorophenyl ring.

To improve the JNK3 score, I propose combining favorable features from both molecules and introducing a slight modification to enhance binding affinity. Specifically:

- Use the thiazole ring from the second molecule, as sulfur can enhance hydrophobic interactions.
- Retain the piperazine sulfonamide motif but replace the chlorophenyl with a para-fluorophenyl to reduce steric hindrance and potentially improve binding.
- Add a small electron-donating methoxy group on the phenyl ring attached to the sulfonamide to increase interactions.
- Keep the rest of the scaffold intact to preserve the core binding interactions.

The first molecule has trifluoromethyl groups and a piperazine moiety, which are also beneficial for activity.

To propose a molecule with potentially higher JNK3 activity, I will combine the beneficial features of both molecules: retain the sulfonamide group and chlorine substituent from the second molecule, keep the trifluoromethyl groups from the first molecule, and maintain the piperazine core for good pharmacokinetics.

Both have the same JNK3 score of 0.71, suggesting these substitutions do not significantly affect activity.

To potentially improve the JNK3 score, I propose introducing a bioisosteric replacement of the trifluoromethyl group with a trifluoromethoxy group (-OCF3), which can enhance binding affinity by adding an oxygen that can participate in additional hydrogen bonding or dipole interactions, while maintaining the electron-withdrawing and lipophilic character.
