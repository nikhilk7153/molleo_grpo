To increase the JNK3 score, we can modify the first molecule by adding a hydrogen atom to the carboxylic acid group, which would increase the molecular weight and potentially increase the biological activity. The second molecule can be modified by adding a hydrogen atom to the benzene ring, which would also increase the molecular weight and potentially increase the biological activity. Therefore, the new molecule with a higher JNK3 score would be the one with the modified carboxylic acid group or the modified benzene ring.\n<<<Molecule>>>: COOHc1ccccc1", "extraction_successful": false, "parsing_failed": true}}
