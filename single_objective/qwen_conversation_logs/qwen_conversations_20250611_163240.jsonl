The new molecule will also have a positively charged nitrogen to enhance its binding affinity.\n\n<<<Molecule>>>: \\box{C1=CC=C(C(=O)N(C2=CC=CC=C2)C(=O)N(C3=CC=CC=C3)C(=O)N(C4=CC=CC=C4)C(=O)N(C5=CC=CC=C5)C(=O)N(C6=CC=CC=C6)C(=O)N(C7=CC=CC=C7)C(=O)N(C8=CC=CC=C8)C(=O)N(C9=CC=CC=C9)C(=O)N(C10=CC=CC=C10)C(=O)N(C11=CC=CC=C11)C(=O)N(C12=CC=CC=C12)C(=O)N(C13=CC=CC=C13)C(=O)N(C14=CC=CC=C14)C(=O)N(C15=CC=CC=C15)C(=O)N(C16=CC=CC=C16)C(=O)N(C17=CC=CC=C17)C(=O)N(C18=CC=CC=C18)C(=O)N(C19=CC=CC=C19)C(=O)N(C20=CC=CC=C20)C(=O)N(C21=CC=CC=C21)C(=O)N(C22=CC=CC=C22)C(=O)N(C23=CC=CC=C23)C(=O)N(C24=CC=CC=C24)C(=O)N(C25=CC=CC=C25)C(=O)N(C26=CC=CC=C26)C(=O)N(C27=CC=CC=C27)C(=O)N(C28=CC=CC=C28)C(=O)N(C29=CC=CC=C29)C(=O)N(C30=CC=CC=C30)C(=O)N(C31=CC=CC=C31)C(=O)N(C32=CC=CC=C32)C(=O)N(C33=CC=CC=C33)C(=O)N(C34=CC=CC=C34)C(=O)N(C35=CC=CC=C35)C(=O)N(C36=CC=CC=C36)C(=O)N(C37=CC=CC=C37)C(=O)N(C38=CC=CC=C38)C(=O)N(C39=CC=CC=C39)C(=O)N(C40=CC=CC=C40)C(=O)N(C41=CC=CC=C41)C(=O)N(C42=CC=CC=C42)C(=O)N(C43=CC=CC=C43)C(=O)N(C44=CC=CC=C44)C(=O)N(C45=CC=CC=C45)C(=O)N(C46=CC=CC=C46)C(=O)N(C47=CC=CC=C47)C(=O)N(C48=CC=CC=C48)C(=O)N(C49=CC=CC=C49)C(=O)N(C50=CC=CC=C50)C(=O)N(C51=CC=CC=C51)C(=O)N(C52=CC=CC=C52)C(=O)N(C53=CC=CC=C53)C(=O)N(C54=CC=CC=C54)C(=O)N(C55=CC=CC=C55)C(=O)N(C56=CC=CC=C56)C(=O)N(C57=CC=CC=C57)C(=O)N(C58=CC=CC=C58)C(=O)N(C59=CC=CC=C59)C(=O)N(C60=CC=CC=C60)C(=O)N(C61=CC=CC=C61)C(=O)N(C62=CC=CC=C62)C(=O)N(C63=CC=CC=C63)C(=O)N(C64=CC=CC=C64)C(=O)N(C65=CC=CC=C65)C(=O)N(C66=CC=CC=C66)C(=O)N(C67=CC=CC=C67)C(=O)N(C68=CC=CC=C68)C(=O)N(C69=CC=CC=C69)C(=O)N(C70=CC=CC=C70)C(=O)N(C71=CC=CC=C71)C(=O)N(C72=CC=CC=C72)C(=O)N(C73=CC=CC=C73)C(=O)N(C74=CC=CC=C74)C(=O)N(C75=CC=CC=C75)C(=O)N(C76=CC=CC=C76)C(=O)N(C77=CC=CC=C77)C(=O)N(C78=CC=CC=C78)C(=O)N(C79=CC=CC=C79)C(=O)N(C80=CC=CC=C80)C(=O)N(C81=CC=CC=C81)C(=O)N(C82=CC=CC=C82)C(=O)N(C83=CC=CC=C83)C(=O)N(C84=CC=CC=C84)C(=O)N(C85=CC=CC=C85)C(=O)N(C86=CC=CC=C86)C(=O)N(C87=CC=CC=C87)C(=O)N(C88=CC=CC=C88)C(=O)N(C89=CC=CC=C89)C(=O)N(C90=CC=CC=C90)C(=O)N(C91=CC=CC=C91)C(=O)N(C92=CC=CC=C92)C(=O)N(C93=CC=CC=C93)C(=O)N(C94=CC=CC=C94)C(=O)N(C95=CC=CC=C95)C(=O)N(C96=CC=CC=C96)C(=O)N(C97=CC=CC=C97)C(=O)N(C98=CC=CC=C98)C(=O)N(C99=CC=CC=C99)C(=O)N(C100=CC=CC=C100)C(=O)N(C101=CC=CC=C101)C(=O)N(C102=CC=CC=C102)C(=O)N(C103=CC=CC=C103)C(=O)N(C104=CC=CC=C104)C(=O)N(C105=CC=CC=C105)C(=O)N(C106=CC=CC=C106)C(=O)N(C107=CC=CC=C107)C(=O)N(C108=CC=CC=C108)C(=O)N(C109=CC=CC=C109)C(=O)N(C110=CC=CC=C110)C(=O)N(C111=CC=CC=C111)C(=O)N(C112=CC=CC"}], "metadata": {"parent_molecules": ["C[C@H]([NH2+][C@H]1CCOC1)c1ccnc(Cl)c1", "Cc1nn(C)cc1CNC(=O)c1ccc(Cn2cc(Cl)c([N+](=O)[O-])n2)cc1"], "parent_scores": [0.03, 0.05], "mutation_rate": 0.0, "task": "jnk3"}}

Based on these considerations, I propose a new molecule with a hydroxyl group attached to the aromatic ring and a carboxyl group replacing one of the existing substituents.

This new molecule is designed to have a higher JNK3 score by increasing the number of potential binding sites and enhancing the overall molecular complexity.\n\n<<<Molecule>>>: \\box{CC1=CC(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(Nc4cccc5ccccc45)ncnc3c2)C1Nc1cccc(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(Nc4CCCC4)ncnc3c2)c1C(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(Nc3cccc4ccccc34)ncnc2c1.O=COCC(=O)O.O=[S]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O]([O"}], "metadata": {"parent_molecules": ["CC1=CC(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(Nc4cccc5ccccc45)ncnc3c2)C1Nc1cccc(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(Nc4cccc5ccccc45)ncnc3c2)c1C(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(Nc3cccc4ccccc34)ncnc2c1.O=COCC(=O)O.O=[SH](=O)c1cc2c3csc-3c-2c1", "CC(Nc1cccc(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(N4CCCC4)ncnc3c2)c1)c1ccccc1OC(=O)N[SH]c1ccccc1"], "parent_scores": [0.21, 0.22], "mutation_rate": 0.0, "task": "jnk3"}}

This new molecule will have a higher JNK3 score due to the increased number of potential binding sites and the presence of hydroxyl and amide groups.\n\n<<<Molecule>>>: \\box{CC1=CC=C(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(Nc4cccc5ccccc45)ncnc3c2)C1Nc1cccc(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(Nc4cccc5ccccc45)ncnc3c2)c1C(=O)Oc1ccc2c(c1)N=C2OC(=O)OCc1ccccc1C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(Nc3cccc4ccccc34)ncnc2c1C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(Nc3cccc4ccccc34)ncnc2c1C(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(=O)NC1CC(=O)N(C2CC2)C1OC(=O)Oc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(O)C(=O)Nc1ccc2c"}], "metadata": {"parent_molecules": ["CC1=CN=C(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(N4CCCC4)ncnc3c2)C1C(=O)NS(=O)(=O)C1C=CC=C1C(=O)Nc1cccc(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(N4CCCC4)ncnc3c2)c1Oc1ccc2c(NC(=O)c3cccc(C(=O)O)c3)ncnc2c1CNc1ccc2c(NC(=O)c3cccc(C(=O)O)c3)ncnc2c1CN", "CC1=CC=C(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(Nc4cccc5ccccc45)ncnc3c2)C1Nc1cccc(C(=O)Nc2ccc3c(Nc4cccc5ccccc45)ncnc3c2)c1C(=O)Oc1ccc2c(c1)N=C2OC(=O)OCc1ccccc1C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(Nc3cccc4ccccc34)ncnc2c1C(=O)Nc1ccc2c(Nc3cccc4ccccc34)ncnc2c1C(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(=O)NC1CC(=O)N(C2CC2)C1OC(=O)O"], "parent_scores": [0.27, 0.22], "mutation_rate": 0.0, "task": "jnk3"}}
